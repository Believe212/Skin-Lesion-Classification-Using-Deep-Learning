# Skin-Lesion-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
In this project, I am developing a robust deep learning pipeline using TensorFlow and EfficientNet to classify skin lesions from medical images. Using a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution
skin images, I am continuously training and validating the model, refining its performance to handle large-scale data and build scalable machine learning solutions. By leveraging data
augmentation, balanced class weighting, and transfer learning, this model is designed to assist in the early detection of skin cancer and encourage timely consultations with healthcare
professionals.
This ongoing work demonstrates my ability to design and implement real-world, end-to-end machine learning solutions that aim to make a meaningful impact in healthcare. As the project
progresses, I am optimizing the model further and exploring new techniques to enhance its accuracy and reliability.
